# CodeType

## Vision
- As students, we enjoy a little bit of competition. We also want to game-ify this competition.
- We, like many others, have had difficulty keeping motivation high in regards to recruiting.
- This tool, CodeType, is designed to solve this issue.

## How will we unite software engineers
- We plan to create a typing competition like no other.
- While typing speed, accuracy, and completion matter, we plan to ramp up the stakes:
    - The users will be typing common data structures or algorithms, 
    such as binary search, sorting functions, implementing stacks, etc.
    - We will have two game modes:
        - Timed: 30, 60, 90, 120 seconds
        - Competition: easy/medium/hard bot or other online users
    - The algorithms will be written in placeholder text for users to fill in, while the 
    competition mode will feature a slider to compare how you are doing against your competition.

## To Do (higher priority is higher in list):
- Accept user input as text (typing)
- Create placeholder text (Algos)
- Have the user's text overlap with the placeholder text (if the same) or show an error (if different)
- Different algorithms (Aim for 500+ different implementations)
    - Some code will be hyper-optimized, some will be redundant on purpose.
        - ie. one line for loop vs multi-line for loop
        - excess print statement :)
    - Multi-language support. Aiming to start with (Python, Java, JS, C++, C)
- Dark + light mode (Dark mode >>>)
- Timed and competition game modes
    - Timed: single player. Start with this.
    - Competition: multi-player option. A lot harder to implement. 
- Implement bots (easy = x cpm, medium = y cpm, hard = z cpm) --> cpm = characters/minute
- Implement scoreboard + ranking system
    - Login 
        - Create account OR login through 3rd party account (Google, Microsoft, Github)
    - User Settings/Preferences
        - Change colour scheme 
            - Default: Dark mode, Alt: Light mode
            - Offer ability to change 2 colours (background and text)
        - Profile picture
        - Username
        - Text size
- Ads AFTER first race (likely Google ads, but can adjust at a later time)
